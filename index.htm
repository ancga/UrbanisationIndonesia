                The world is rapidly urbanizing. According to the <a
                    href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.POP.DNST">World Bank</a> In 2010, over half of the
                world's population resided in urban regions,
                with that number continuing to climb. Indonesia is one of the many nations where urbanization has taken
                root. In fact, half of Indonesia's population lived in urban areas by 2010, a trend that continues to
                accelerate at a rapid pace. Among these urban areas is the bustling capital of Jakarta, where almost 10
                million of the nation's 273 million inhabitants call home. As Indonesia's urbanization story unfolds, it
                raises questions about the future of its rural areas and the impact of this shift on Indonesian society
                as a whole.

                Indonesia's urban population is expected to reach 56% by 2020, up from just 14% in 1960. More than 70%
                of the population is anticipated to reside in cities by 2045. Government expenditure on urban planning
                and infrastructure, however, has lagged behind, leading to a number of issues such as overcrowding, a
                lack of affordable housing, inefficient waste management, water contamination, traffic, and more.

        <h3>Urban-Rural Population</h3>
        <div class="first">
            <p>Until the 1980s, both Indonesia's urban and rural populations increased gradually, with the rural
                population far outnumbering the urban. After 40 years of strong growth, urban population reached the
                majority for the first time in 2011, preceded and followed by a minor but continuous decline in the
                rural population. This tendency is expected to continue in the next decades.</p>

        <h3>Urban Aglomerations and Cities with the Largest Population</h3>
        <div class="second">
            <p>Indonesia has several large and rapidly growing cities, including Jakarta (the capital), Surabaya,
                Bandung, and Medan. This part tells the trend of the top 10 growing cities of Indonesia as the target of
                urbanization. This has created overcrowding in some provinces especially in the Java island.</p>

        <h3>From Disproportionate Population Density to Unequal Access to Urban Amenities and Facilties</h3>
        <div class="third"></div>
        <div>
            <p>Another challenge is the high population density, which puts more pressure on existing infrastructure.
                From
                2000 to 2010, the urban population density in Indonesia increased from 7,400 to 9,400 people per square
                kilometer, making it one of the most densely populated countries in the region. Moreover, only 48% of
                households have access to safe water, and sewerage coverage exists in only 11 out of the country's 98
                cities.
